# L_Webring
A [Webring](https://github.com/IKaramitsos/L_Webring) built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s [static routing redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

This webring is inspired by a [tutorial](https://mincerafter42.github.io/tutorial/webring/) I found online. The ring welcomes hand-crafted wikis and portfolios.

# Example

See the [Demo Site](https://lwebring.netlify.app/) generated by this code.

# How to host a ring

1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit `/_data/members.csv` and fill in your community info.
3. <b> Publish the webring</b> , Start a new Netlify site form the repository.
4. Make sure to set the domain to the same one you have in `_config.yml`, and make sure you have the following build settings:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start)

| Base directory | Build command                  | Publish directory |
|  :---          |     :---                       |          :---     |
| `Not Set`      | `bundle exec jekyll build`     | `_site`           |

5. You can also make changes in the `index.html` file.

If all goes well, you should see your webring when you navigate to your domain, and each member will be able to use their links as described!
If your GitHub repository is still private, make sure to set it to public now.
